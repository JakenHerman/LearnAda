# LearnAda
These are sample programs I created while learning the Ada programming language for Data Structures & Algorithms. I have created skeleton code so you can try to implement these programs yourself, while having my solutions to fall back on if you get stuck.

To Compile your code:
-
<sub><sup>*Note, you will need to install [gnatmake & ada](http://libre.adacore.com/), and these commands are for *NIX based systems.*</sub></sup>

Use the command `gnatmake -o filename filename.adb`

To Run your code:
-
Use the command `./filename`.



AGE_DIFFERENCE
=
This was my first Ada Program. This introduced me to text i/o and integer i/o, as well as conditionals and printing text and integers in the sameline by using `Integer'Image(VAR_NAME)`. You can use this as a solution/guide when trying to create the replica version. I have created the skeleton code for you in **LEARN_AGE_DIFFERENCE.adb**. Feel free to code the solution yourself in order to increase your knowledge of the Ada programming language.

LINKED_LIST
=
This was my second Ada Program. This allowed me to better understand the linked list data structure and using Ada loops, and types. I have created the skeleton code for you in **learn_linked_list.adb**. Feel free to code the solution yourself in order to increase your knowledge of the Ada programming language.

GNOME_SORT
=
This was my third Ada Program. This allowed me to work more with Ada arrays and swapping the values of array positions in order to sort numerical data. I have created the skeleton code for you in **learn_gnome_sort.adb**. Feel free to code the solution yourself in order to increase your knowledge of the Ada programming language.
